### Feminist Hardware Clay PCB: Action Donau Island 
## Location: Floor 1 at Postsparkasse/GCP - Department of Digitale Kunst

Feminist Hardware speculates on technologies instigating debates on fair-traded, ethical, biodegradable hardware for environmental justice. We build circuits that use ancient community-centred crafts and knowledge as an artistic practice encouraging de-colonial thinking, market forces to be disobeyed, and future technologies for the Chthulucene to be imagined. Our PCB is not made of plastic but instead wild clay retrieved from the forest in Austria and fired on a bonfire in a Barbecue area at the Donauinsel. The project is a collaboration between Patrícia J. Reis & the students of Electronic Tinkering 101 – Arduino & DIY at the Digitale Kunst Department. The Clay PCB is the outcome of the Feminist Hardware project conceived by Patrícia J. Reis and Stefanie Wuschitz (PEEK AR580).
