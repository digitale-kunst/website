### Martin Gius

memories in the present past <br/>
Duration: 6'16

'memories in the present past' is a music video for the hungarian artist Alley Catss.
The video material is sourced from unused footage of the short documentary 'freedom in the present past', directed by Daniel Hüttler, Pille-Riin Jaik, Klaus Rabeder and Janina Weißengruber, which explores the history of four family houses in Austria, Hungary and Estonia.
Here, the footage is manipulated using the video synthesizer 'Hydra' to make the images flow seamlessly in and out of each other and follow the hypnagogic feel of the music.

Bio: Martin Gius is a computer scientist and musician based in Vienna, where he is in the Experimental Game Cultures Master's Program of the University of Applied Arts. He likes to create playful environments for creating music and visuals.
