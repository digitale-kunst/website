### Rage

Cyborgs are jealous of me <br />
Duration: 6'21

"Cyborgs are jealous of me" reflects on the lifelong journey with neurodermatitis. It tells stories from the past and inner dialogue of recurring thoughts within a body that is suffering from the chronic skin condition. From loathing and constant devaluation, to acceptance and the ability to see the condition as a skill. One that is worth cherishing, rather than just seeing it as a limitation to the enjoyment of life and a constant burden.

Rage is a multidisciplinary artist. Using a variety of media in the physical as well as the digital space. Her works aspire to allow a look into the depths of the psyche. She combines the uncanny with the melancholic, the deep calm with the steady unrest.
