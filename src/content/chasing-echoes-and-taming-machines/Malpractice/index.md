### Malpractice

Fatigue Archive
Duration: 7'50

FATIGUE ARCHIVE is an experimental film built from live, unscripted conversations between humans and a custom "fatigue rehab agent" AI. Developed in response to burnout from constant AI interaction, the project captures digital overload, emotional responses to automation, and collective anxieties. Set to flickering AI-generated imagery at 24 fps, the film acts as an automated ethnography and time capsule of human-AI relations in a moment of cultural transition.
