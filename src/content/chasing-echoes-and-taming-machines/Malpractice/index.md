### Malpractice

Fatigue Archive<br/>
Duration: 7'50

"Fatigue Archive" is an experimenta film built from live, unscripted conversations between humans and a custom "fatigue rehab agent" AI. Developed in response to burnout from constant AI interaction, the project captures digital overload, emotional responses to automation, and collective anxieties. Set to flickering AI-generated imagery at 24 fps, the film acts as an automated ethnography and time capsule of human-AI relations in a moment of cultural transition.

Malpractice is composed of Marcin Ratajczyk, Chiara Kristler, and a shifting ensemble of AI counterparts. The group explores AI not as a tool but as a collaborator in distributed creative processes where authorship becomes porous and plural.
