### AEON GAWA (Hartwin Haselbauer)

Why day is it <br/>
Duration: 5'

When the mind is an evolute of matter, 'Why day is it' opens a field of possibilities, combining and fusing symbolic values (condensation) extracted from the material world into psychoanalytic representation of thoughts, objects or ideas. The work explores mental experiments in which the common logic of space, the self and materiality no longer serves as a limiting framework. A dreamlike essence remains.

Bio: Aeon Gawa, the artistic pseudonym of Hartwin Haselbauer, is an Austrian digital artist whose work engages with the intricate landscapes of the human psyche. His art explores the complexity of individual inner universes, translating psychological and/or spiritual depth into digital forms.
