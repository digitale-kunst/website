Binary Reflections <br/>
Duration: 8'59

Binary Reflections navigates the subtle convergence of personal recollections and political undercurrents, revealing the hidden layers within family VHS tapes from 1990s Istanbul. Using artificial intelligence and TensorFlow's image recognition, the film transforms ordinary moments—birthdays, reunions—into potent reflections of a city in transition. It compels us to confront the unseen forces shaping our lives, reminding us that even the most private memories are never truly apolitical.
