### Mano Leyrado

Natural Contradictions v.01 <br/>
Duration: 2'19

A philosophical reflection on the concept of nature and how we construct it. Centered around a recorded conversation with an artificial agent, the work explores the tensions that arise when attempting to define what is "nature". Throughout the dialogue, the questions posed lead the agent to an absurd conclusion.
The video's imagery features transitions generated by artificial agent tools that recreate textures inspired by landscapes and organic forms, reinforcing the idea of a blurred boundary between what is natural and what is human-made.

Bio: Mano Leyrado (Buenos Aires, 1987) is an Art Curation technician and Sculpture student at Weissensee KHB, exploring technology, materiality, and power systems. Through sculpture and digital media, Mano examines tensions between the physical and virtual with a critical, speculative, and political lens.
