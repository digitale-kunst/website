### Iris Kienzl

In deiner Nähe <br/>
Duration: 5'26

"In deiner Nähe" explores the unsettling dynamics of obsession. Based on real letters from the 1940s, the work traces a man's growing fixation on a woman, as his increasing attachment crosses boundaries and turns into a relentless pursuit. Within a 3D-scanned, abandoned house—the place where the letters were discovered—a disturbing narrative unfolds, where possessiveness and intimacy blur into one. The space itself becomes a silent witness to this obsessive longing.

Iris Kienzl (Vienna, 2002) is currently studying Digital Arts at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. Her recent works explore abandoned places and forgotten objects, using 3D scans to merge digital reconstruction with documentary and narrative elements.
