### Iris Kienzl

In deiner Nähe <br/>
Duration: ~5'

"In deiner Nähe" explores the unsettling dynamics of obsession. Based on real letters from the 1940s, the work traces a man's growing fixation on a woman, as his increasing attachment crosses boundaries and turns into a relentless pursuit. Within a 3D-scanned, abandoned house—the place where the letters were discovered—a disturbing narrative unfolds, where possessiveness and intimacy blur into one. The space itself becomes a silent witness to this obsessive longing.
