### Lea Gander & Matthias Sanoll

Il corridori dell' ombra <br/>
Duration: 4'33

Il corridore dell'ombra explores the shadow self, inspired by the theory of projection. Suppressed desires surface in dreams and obsessions, revealing hidden aspects of the psyche. Three performers embody five roles, merging identity and illusion. The film presents subconscious figures, ephemeral, distorted, yet strangely familiar. An invitation to wander with the shadow runners of our inner worlds and confront reflections we may not recognize as our own.
