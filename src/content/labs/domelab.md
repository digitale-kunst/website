# Dome-LAB

The Dome Lab at the University of Applied Arts, Department of Digitale Kunst, is an experimental space dedicated to immersive projection, sound, and body interaction. 

Currently, it hosts a seminar and project run by Melissa Logan, providing students with the opportunity to explore the boundaries of immersive media, sound and performance. The lab's unique dome structure allows for 360-degree projections, creating an enveloping visual and auditory experience.
