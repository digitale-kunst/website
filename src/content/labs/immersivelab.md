# Immersive-LAB

Welcome to the Immersive Lab of the Digital Arts Department at the University of Applied Arts Vienna â€“ our dynamic hotbed for embedded digital art, where 'Speed Show' exhibitions flip in minutes, from room-filling projections with spatial live performance to surround AI cinema & sound experiences. 

In this hybrid space, presence can turn into pre-experimental hardcore art, hyper-now performances, or unapologetic pop smashers.
