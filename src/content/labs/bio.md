# Bio-LAB 

The Bio Art Lab at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, Department of Digitale Kunst, is an innovative space where art and biology intersect. Managed by Stefan Fischer and supported by student assistant Rage, the lab provides a unique environment for exploring living systems and biological processes through artistic practices. Students and faculty engage with bio-materials and biotechnologies, experimenting with concepts such as bio-edible art and ecological sustainability. The lab also features a collaboration with Sabine Seymour, fostering interdisciplinary projects that blend scientific inquiry with creative expression.
