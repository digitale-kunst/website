# Research-LAB

The Research Lab at the University of Applied Arts, Department of Digitale Kunst, under the guidance of Julian Hessenthaler, is integral to advancing research in digital arts and media. It provides a dedicated space for students and faculty to enhance their research capabilities, promote media literacy, expand research horizons, foster collaborations with other institutions, and develop essential research tools.

The lab is committed to nurturing critical inquiry and interdisciplinary exchange. 

If you want to join the team, you can participate in the seminar offered by the Research-LAB or contact Julian directly.
