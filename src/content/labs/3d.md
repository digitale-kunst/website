# 3D-LAB

The 3D printing lab at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, Department of Digitale Kunst, managed by Stefan Fischer, is a well-equipped facility that supports the exploration of digital and physical art forms. The lab features a specialized clay printer, allowing for the creation of detailed ceramic pieces, as well as a set of PET and other materials printers, which enable the use of diverse and sustainable materials (We recycle!). With the assistance of student assistant Element Lee, the lab provides students and faculty with valuable tools to experiment with new techniques and materials, encouraging experimental, practical and innovative approaches to object production.
