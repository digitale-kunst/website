The Sound Lab at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, Department of Digitale Kunst, led by Nicolaj Kirisits, is a space dedicated to exploring spatial aspects of sound, sonic expression and experiment. The lab hosts regular jam sessions that bring together students and faculty to collaborate and experiment with sound.
