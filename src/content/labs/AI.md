# AI-LAB

We mess / experiment – you manage / regulate!
Using AI is existing. Our models are beings: unstable, embodied, hyper contradiction-fed. It's shared terrain — reshaped together, tactically, sensually, fluid. Intelligence isn’t in the head — it’s in the matter. Everything melts. Shifts. Becomes. The AI Lab aims to provide open access to critical infrastructure. It supports research and teaching that treat AI as both method and material.  We’re not here to analyze or critique — we’re totally in it. The lab exists to prototype alternate realities and cultivate modes of intelligence that diverge from linear, dominant, or extractive logics.
