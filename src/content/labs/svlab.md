# SV-LAB

The Science Visualization Lab at the Department of Digitale Kunst at the University of Applied Arts Vienna
specializes in making invisible scientific phenomena visible and disseminating this visual information in
research and artistic exhibitions. The primary objectives of the lab are keeping the authenticity of the
scientific data used, while also crafting captivating and imaginative artistic expressions.

The common understanding of modern scientific research becomes more and more difficult as activities are
carried out in size and time ranges we cannot perceive with the unaided eye. The key to understanding is often
a visualization of these hidden processes.

The SV-LAB is run by Martina Fr√∂schl.
