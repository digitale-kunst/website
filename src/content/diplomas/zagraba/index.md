The Land of Bearing Shapes
Speculative Reality Concept, 2024

Each of us possesses a specific shape stored in The Land of Bearing Shapes. A Bearing Shape is a unique spatial structure that expresses the essence of every individual. It has a dualistic nature â€“ it is being borne, but it also bears.

The Land of Bearing Shapes aims to explore how emotions, energy, and life itself can be metaphorically expressed in the technical language of CGI 3D graphics. The narrative is based on the mismatch between the complexity of the real world and the limited capacities of 3D software. The viewer is invited to approach The Land of Bearing Shapes by observing it through a virtual mirror and learn about from the guidebook.
