### Joanna Zabielska

Postgranicze. The Borderland of Echoes and Realities
Virtual-Reality-Installation (Dreikanal), 2025

Postgranicze is a world of speculative fiction built upon a foun-
dation of reality. Set in the borderland forests of Podlasie, where
Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine converge, it is a place where the soil
speaks—its voice rich with histories and myths, personal testi-
monies, and magical tales, woven into a tapestry of languages and
dialects. Inspired by the Slavic creation myth, in which the world
is formed by three interconnected elements—sky (niebo), earth
(ziemia), and underground (podziemie)—this experience comes
to life through three VR installations. These realms unfold through
the eyes of three guides: the Great Grandmother, the Whisperer
Witch, and the Traveler. Together, they lead us into a virtual
Post-Borderland—a digital habitat of post-humans, spirits, and
nature that dares to imagine a world free of border regimes. Post-
granicze is both a story and a provocation—a call to imagine the
unimaginable, rooted in the whisper of the land.
