### Kilian Hanappi
looking for you
Net Art / Video-Installation, 2024

An autonomous click-bot navigates in real time through the virtual image of the earth in the mapping service Google Street View. It is a media fl√¢neur (Emilio Vavarella, 2020), an entity that moves fluidly through centers and peripheries. Viewing the world is delegated to a panoptic camera construction that composes space from nine eyes and a height of 2.5 meters. The machinic topology makes familiar landscapes seem alien, and there is a constant change of view between the observer and the observed. How does Google's credo of "organizing the world's information and making it accessible" relate to the legibility, deciphering and interpretation of the world?
