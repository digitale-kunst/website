### Verena Tscherner

entangle. deflate
Deflateable and sound installation, 2024

Violence does not have a single form.
Nor does violence have a simple form.
Violence has many faces.

In 2020, the Canadian Women's Foundation is publicizing the distress signal for domestic violence. The corresponding hand movement consists of three consecutive gestures and can be used inconspicuously when in sight. The spatial installation entangle. deflate touches the senses and draws the viewer's attention to the topic. Its scope is made comprehensible on various levels. Each digital copy of a real hand forms an enclave that is connected to all the others through the irregular alternation between air and vacuum. In this way, a common breeding ground for solidarity and togetherness is created.
