Der Umfang meines Hirns war die Grenze meiner Welt
Speculative media sculpture, 2025

”Der Umfang meines Hirns war die Grenze meiner Welt“ is a self-portrait in the form of a speculative media sculpture. In it, the self begins to dissolve and connect with the technical system - not as a mirror image, but as a trace, as movement through material, rhythm and process. Machines have long since found their place inside the human body. The human being, on the other hand, is abstracted in the machine, preserved as a data set and not accepted as a body.

This work asks how much body a machine can tolerate - whether it can breathe, flow, remember. Machine and human do not meet as extensions, but as interacting species - in a state of fusion, disruption, intimacy.
