### Isabelle Orsini und Rosenberg

Transit
Reactive Sculpture, 2024

Where the gaze meets light in a tangibly close dream, a creature emerges â€” a silhouette shaped like the undulating landscape itself, blurring the boundaries between form and terrain. Through repurposed and discarded car parts, the sculpture resonates with a sense of technological transcendence maintaining a constant connection, a pathway.
Transit unites solid soil with the echo of home, inviting viewers to lose themselves in an enigmatic escape from the confines of reality.
