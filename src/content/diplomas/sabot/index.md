### Luca Sabot

Apparatus #5
Kinetic sculpture, 2023/24

Humans create machines to handle tasks they do not want to execute, to streamline processes that are tedious or energy-intensive. I am intrigued by the idea of building machines that deal with emotions I cannot handle. These apparatuses are made to meticulously reconstruct and mediate emotional impulses.

Apparatus #5 consists of a delicate mechanism that is splitting teeth, one at a time.

Teeth can be a source of pleasure and pain. The work conveys the medical condition of stress-induced teeth clenching. By processing donor teeth it alleviates the pressure from their former holders.
