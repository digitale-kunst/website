Mens Capta 
Immersive installation combining sensory narrative, dystopian aesthetics, and psychological exploration, 2025

Mens capta—from the Latin mens (mind) and capta (held)—is an immersive installation that seeks to sensorially materialize the states of a panic attack within anxiety and depression—not through literal representation, but through the physical experience of space. Using projection, sound, and reactive atmospheres, the piece constructs a sensory metaphor of an internal cycle in which emotional buildup erupts and eventually returns to a deceptive calm. This introspective dimension of the human experience invites the viewer to inhabit the space as a physical reflection of a mind under tension, navigating a cycle of accumulation, overflow, and the return to an apparent normality.
