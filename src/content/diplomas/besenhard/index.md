Exit House
Installation and Sculpture, 2024

A network is woven from a linear space-time line. Its nodes are stops for a time-traveling archetype. Overlapping moments, both past and expected, form a trickster story. A game with the mobility of meanings, seen from bird's-eye and frog's-eye perspectives.
