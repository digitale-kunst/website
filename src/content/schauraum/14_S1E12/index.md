# S1E12: Apparatus #5
### Luca Sabot
### 12.09. – 15.09.2024
		

Apparatus #5 by Luca Sabot concludes the first season of the Speedshow Series. The kinetic sculpture consists of a delicate mechanism that is splitting teeth, one at a time, four per day. 

Humans create machines to handle tasks they do not want to execute, to streamline processes that are tedious or energy-intensive. Luca Sabot’s machines are made to meticulously reconstruct and mediate emotional impulses. Apparatus #5 conveys the medical condition of stress-induced teeth clenching. By processing donor teeth it alleviates the pressure from their former holders.

Luca Sabot finished his studies at the Digitale Kunst Department in summer 2024.
