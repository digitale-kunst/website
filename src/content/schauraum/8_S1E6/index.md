# S1E6: Look at me for long
### Rage, Mahdi Bakhshi, Element Lee 
### 24.04. – 06.05.2024 
		
Look at me for long explores the intricacy of introspective and consciousness, where perception blurs and the concept of self dissolves into fragments of existence.
 
The works of Rage, Mahdi Bakhshi and Element Lee delve into the depths of the subconscious inviting contemplation on the fleeting nature of existence and idea of identity and space.
Between the enigmacicity of their artworks lies a narrative woven from the depths of the human psyche—a tale of circles, isolation, and the elusive pursuit of security. As individuals seek solace and protection within the confines of their own circles, they confront the complexities of existence, where boundaries dissolve, identities shift, and the quest for meaning unfolds through cryptic pathways.

Rage, Mahdi Bakhshi, and Element Lee are students at Digitale Kunst.
