### the Futile Corporation: Aliasing

Aliasing refers to the visual distortion or artifacting that occurs when a digital signal is inadequately sampled or displayed. In both the digital and physical realms, aliasing describes undesirable effects. Whether in digital representations, visual pollution or environmental degradation, the perception of unwanted artifacts always remains dependent on the viewer.

### 01.02.–11.02.
### David Obradović: Unglaublich! Orthodoxe Ikonen brechen ihr Schweigen! 
	
The installation by David Obradović deals with the power of faith and its representation in the Orthodox Church. Eight selected icons transmit the light of Orthodox churches transformed into sound. The images floating in space form an ambisonic dome around the viewer. Come and listen to the illuminating sounds of the holy warriors!
