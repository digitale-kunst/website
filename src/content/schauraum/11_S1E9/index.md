# S1E9: Be the Living Room
### Lea Gander, Vivi Vinjarova
### 06.06. – 16.06.2024
		
Be the Living Room explores conditions of the inside and the outside, as well as interplays and boundaries between both. What does it mean to be comfortable, without restrictions and free from expectations? – The artists invite viewers to perceive a speculative (spatial) construct where they present individual longings for co-existing of vulnerability and authenticity. Living Room in this context stands for an intimate space where one can reflect upon inner desires, frustrations and constraints without the intrusion or judgment of the outside world.
 
The installation Bruxism: Synaptic Warfare (2024) by Lea Gander reveals a landscape where dreams and desires materialize, inviting contemplation of the unseen forces shaping our realities and reminding us of the profound connections between life, death, and the spaces found in between. 
 
What we may or may have not found in the dark (2024) by Vivi Vinjarova is a tapestry made from countless pieces. Digital drawings were transferred into embroideries, in search for the constraints of authenticity and art. The work reflects on the genuine, on what it means to create fine arts or "just" illustration.
