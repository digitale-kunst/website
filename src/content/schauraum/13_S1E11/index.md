# S1E11: Object / Body / Dream

### David Obradović, Franci Kas & Rage

### 19.06. – 01.07.2024

The eleventh Speedshow episode features works by David Obradović and as well as by Franci Kas and Rage that show their relationship to objects and their materiality and perception.

### 04.07. – 09.07.

### David Obradović: Objective Sound

David Obradović shows a sound installation and a clay-electronic sculpture. The installation presents sound recordings of the Stone Flower Monument on the Croatian-Bosnian border in a restructured form and places them 475 km from the starting point. The three-part cross sculpture uses naturally produced clay and electronics to illustrate the modern relationship between human, technology and the inexplicable. The work combines perception through restructuring and the artist's personal exploration of his faith and upbringing.

Opening hours: Daily from 19:00 – 21:00

### 11.07. – 15.07.

### Franci Kas & Rage: Lithe

Instincts, socialized behaviors and belief systems, myths and desires merging together. Departing from the personal, Lithe explores the process of materialization, reflects on what has not yet become, and cultivates kinship with physical matter by asking the question: Can I give myself what I have always wanted? The joint exhibition consists of the project retamed body by Franci Kas, and Rage´s object Dissipated Light.

Opening hours: Daily from 10:00 – 22:00

The artists of Episode 11 study at the Digitale Kunst Department.
