the Futile Corporation: Aliasing

Aliasing describes visual distortions or artifacts that occur when a digital signal is inadequately sampled or displayed. In both the digital and physical worlds, aliasing refers to unwanted effects. Whether in the space of digital representations, visual pollution, or environmental degradation, the perception of unwanted artifacts always remains dependent on the viewer.

### 01.02. – 11.02.
David Obradović: Unbelievable! Orthodox icons break their silence!

David Obradović's installation deals with the power of faith and its representation in the Orthodox Church. Eight selected icons transmit the light of Orthodox churches converted into sound. The images floating in the room form an ambisonic dome around the viewer. Come by and listen to the illuminating sounds of the holy warriors!
