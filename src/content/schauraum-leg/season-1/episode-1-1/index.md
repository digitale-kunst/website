the Futile Corporation: Aliasing

Aliasing describes visual distortions or artifacts that occur when a digital signal is inadequately sampled or displayed. In both the digital and physical worlds, aliasing refers to unwanted effects. Whether in the space of digital representations, visual pollution, or environmental degradation, the perception of unwanted artifacts always remains dependent on the viewer.
