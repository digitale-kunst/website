In the lecture The Final Form of Thought: Becoming the Product, Morgane Billuart explores how critical internet research has evolved within an attention-driven digital landscape. Tracing a line from the early net criticism of Geert Lovink to the influencer-like intellectual practices of Joshua Citarella, Alex Quicho, and Sophie Public, she examines how researchers navigate visibility, independence, and survival in an economy that rewards constant engagement.

Through this lens, the research, in its theoretical product (book) or in its practice (the podcast), reveals the growing tension between critique and commodification, where scholarly rigor meets aesthetic branding, and intellectual labor becomes inseparable from self-promotion. Becoming the Product asks: What does it mean to think critically when thought itself must perform online?
