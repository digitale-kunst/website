# Schauraum MQ
The Schauraum is the exhibition space of the Institute of Fine Arts at the University of Applied Arts at the MuseumsQuartier Wien MQ. It was run by the department of Digitale Kunst from 2010 to 2025.

# SpeedShowSeries SSS
The Schauraum hosted the Digitale Kunst Speedshow Series from 2023 to 2025 - a format for collaborations between students and young artists affiliated with the Angewandte.  

The concept: Students develop a curation including texts and materials for collaborative projects (episodes) that run for two weeks. Artistic processes and thoughts are concretized and achieved in a short amount of time. 

# Location
The Speedshows move on to a new location coming up soon.
