## The Department of Digitale Kunst
Our department is an open platform and a safe-enough space for experimenting with digital media in an artistic context. We offer customizable spaces, state-of-the-art technical equipment, passionate people and inclusive access to new worlds and realities. We do art, basic research, aesthetic and technology development, social and political experiments and action. Present and future facets of art, entertainment and science are imagined, discussed and applied. We value collaboration, communication, divergence, risk-taking and openness. We are hyper-contemporary in all aspects.
