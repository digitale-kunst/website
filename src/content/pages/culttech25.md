## Research and Educational Advances in Culture and Technology (REACT 2025)
## Angewandte Digital Arts Showcase 

Curated by UBERMORGEN/Luzius Bernhard & Liz Haas

22.10.2025 und 23.10.2025
Aula der Wissenschaften, Wollzeile 27A, 1010 Vienna

A collaboration between the CultTech Summit and the Digital Arts Department of the University of Applied Arts Vienna (Angewandte)

This exhibition presents works by students of the Digital Arts Department who critically engage with technology, storytelling, and contemporary media. The showcase spans painting, video, sculpture, readymades, media hacking, and kinetic installation, highlighting how creative practice explores machine agency, human traces, and the speculative possibilities of digital culture.

Some works reach beyond the gallery walls. QR-linked stories, online archives, and live electronics invite visitors to follow narratives, examine processes, and discover hidden layers within each piece.

The pieces featured in the Angewandte Digital Arts Showcase are critical, speculative, and sometimes provocative. They challenge assumptions about technology, memory, and authorship, inviting audiences to reflect on what is left behind as machines inherit traces of human activity.

Featured Artists and Works: Anahí Juárez — Geisterjagd; Verena Tscherner — nie game over; Michael Guggenbichler — Der Umfang meines Hirns war die Grenze meiner Welt; AEON GAWA — Survivalism through Replication; Koschka Keye — #IVYCORE; NotToday (Sara Martínez & Nicolás Henao-Bonnet) — BitRot, Klára Klimas — A bird that mistook a streetlamp for the Sun. 

The CultTech Emerging Artist Award will recognize the most outstanding works in the showcase, celebrating innovation, critical engagement, and artistic courage in digital arts.

Special Thanks: Digital Arts Department, University of Applied Arts Vienna (Angewandte) and all participating artists.
