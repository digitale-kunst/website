# Labs

The department of Digitale Kunst is home to a set of labs, which are open to be used by students at any time. All the labs are located at the department in Postsparkasse. If you want to use the labs but are not a DK student, please contact the lab admins so you can get access and/or an introduction into the respective lab.

Some of the labs have existing cooperations with outside partners. If you are interested in becoming a partner send us a note!

Lab now, orate later!
