# Angewandte Festival 2025

## EXHIBITION at Digitale Kunst
# It’s Just a Fantasy: A Matter of Survival and Being Truthful

![](./its-just-a-fantasy-poster.jpg)

It's Just a Fantasy: A Matter of Survival and Being Truthful traces the line between survival and truth in a world in crisis mode. Amidst AI agents, robots, and human deception, we search for figures of thought that do not capitulate. Instead of apocalypse and dystopia: glitches, contradictions, desires. The exhibition asks what remains when fantasy is not an escape, but a place where future is negotiated.

## TAVOLATA. On standing out and fitting in

26.06. – 29.06.2024

In the contemporary era, the acknowledgment and appreciation of diversity are widely embraced, yet adhering to societal norms might be perceived as an onerous obligation. In contrast, inclusion represents the act of embracing and understanding others. The Digital Art Table engages in conversations about how to negotiate cultural norms while maintaining our uniqueness. We skillfully balance the act of conforming to social expectations while still expressing our individuality. The round table, an enduring emblem of egalitarianism, fosters discourse and cooperation. Every artwork here holds significance and leads to innovative solutions and a more profound comprehension. You are cordially invited to experience the fusion of artistic expression, culinary delights, and emotional ambiance. The Digital Art Table is available daily starting at 1 p.m. Every day during the festival's operating hours, as well as at different sites within the Angewandte. WELCOME, HAVE YOU MADE A TABLE RESERVATION?
