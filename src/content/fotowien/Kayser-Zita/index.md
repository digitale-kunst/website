### Zita Kayser

Fiebertraum<br/>

The creation of the photo series Fiebertraum (Fever Dream) is characterized by a series of coincidences and events that led the photographer to find herself on the premises of South Africa’s third-largest coal-fired power plant.
As a European abroad, one is usually confronted with the mistakes of the past, provided that the discomfort is bearable and not drowned out by the banal joys of consumerism.<br/>
To cultivate a climate of reflection is an act of confronting the past: it demands awareness of how privilege and history are intertwined. Yet not everyone is willing or able to grasp how deeply South Africa’s coal-fired power plants and European life in the twenty-first century are entangled.
