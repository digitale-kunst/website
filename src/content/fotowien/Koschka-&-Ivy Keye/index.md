###  Koschka & Ivy Keye

maughter.exe<br/>

maughter.exe is a refusal. A womb speaking back. It reclaims motherhood as an autonomous force - unruly, desiring, unsanctioned. This is not metaphor, not simulation, but a lived genesis: hormonal, absurd, and real. In a world of predictive systems and speculative futures, maughter.exe insists on embodied authorship. It doesnâ€™t ask permission. It births what it wants.
