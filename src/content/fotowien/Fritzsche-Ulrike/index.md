### Ulrike Fritzsche

Nymph nostalgia<br/>

Aschenbrecher embraces their speculative digital persona, a magical nymph caught in the liminal space between model collapse and reality. These images are manifestations of a desire to transcend the post digital condition, weaving nostalgia, dreaminess, and myth into vision of self.
The nymph becomes a vessel for reimagining identity beyond binaries of nature and technology, illusion and authenticity.@dieaschenbrecher
