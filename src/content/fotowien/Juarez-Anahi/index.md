### Anahi Juárez

Geisterjagd<br/>

Geisterjagd begins with a hunch: that digital images—those bodiless entities circulating through screens, networks, and devices—are ghostly in nature. They are collective hallucinations, fragile and fleeting. This project attempts to trap them through a deliberately archaic gesture: painting directly onto computer screens, cameras, and laptops, sealing these devices as haunted objects—ritual surfaces that can no longer be updated, reproduced, or connected.<br/>
Once painted, the devices are carried into the forest and photographed at night, using flash. In these encounters, they appear as magical relics, as if they were archaeological traces of a lost techno-mystical civilization. The images evoke the uncanny kinship between the internet and the woods, echoing the iconography of online paranormal culture—haunted videos, abandoned cameras, glitches that rupture reality.<br/>
Ultimately, Geisterjagd is a spectral hunt: an attempt to think with images, through them, and against them. A search for what still resists domestication by the logic of digital transparency.
