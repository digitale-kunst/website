### Hartwin Haselbauer Hartwin & Tina Grüll 

Schnipsel<br/>

How do computers perceive space and surface?<br/>
This work is a form of documentation through functional “photographs”—not intended for human eyes, yet ultimately readable.<br/>
This post-human mode of representing surface information of virtual sculptures derived from physical reality constitutes a kind of working language. It decomposes a depiction of three-dimensional reality into flat, mathematical perspectives, thereby reconstructing digital reality anew—a photograph translated for machines.
