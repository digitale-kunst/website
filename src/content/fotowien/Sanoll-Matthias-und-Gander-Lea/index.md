### Matthias Sanoll & Lea Gander

Liminal Nexus<br/>

Photoseries & Videoinstallation,
Portugal, 2025<br/><br/>

It is as real as we make it.<br/>
Here we stand in the Liminal Nexus, on the threshold between ending and beginning.<br/>
Drifting away from the home we gave each other.<br/>
We blur, rearrange, dissolve, and return as something half-known.<br/>
Yes to be held by uncertainty.<br/>
Yes to reveal intimacy through distance.<br/>
Yes to linger in ambiguity.<br/>
Itâ€™s the pause before understanding, the momentum of dissolution and reformation.<br/>
BOOOOOOOOOOMMM<br/>
We untangle ourselves from the figure we merged into and run towards invisible horizons.<br/>
Come, come to a place far away from me.<br/>
What was my name again?<br/>
The sound of something breaking is the only thing we hear now.<br/>
Contradiction is the only tongue left while hiking 30 km a day and performing for the birds.<br/>
Plastic, fog, and silver beam,<br/>
Here we are, falling into the in-between.<br/>
In the hope it will make the breakup less painful, we shared another Snickers.<br/>
It tasted good.<br/>
Goodbye Madeira.<br/>
A goodbye in Madeira.<br/>
