### Matthias Sanoll & Lea Gander

Liminal Nexus<br/>
Photoseries & Videoinstallation,
Portugal, 2025<br/>

It is as real as we make it.<br/>
Here we stand in the Liminal Nexus, on the threshold between ending and beginning.<br/>
Drifting away from the home we gave each other.<br/>
We blur, rearrange, dissolve, and return as something half-known.<br/>
Yes to be held by uncertainty.<br/>
Yes to reveal intimacy through distance.<br/>
Yes to linger in ambiguity.<br/>
It’s the pause before understanding, the momentum of dissolution and reformation.<br/>
BOOOOOOOOOOMMM<br/>
We untangle ourselves from the figure we merged into and run towards invisible horizons.<br/>
Come, come to a place far away from me.<br/>
What was my name again?<br/>
The sound of something breaking is the only thing we hear now.<br/>
Contradiction is the only tongue left while hiking 30 km a day and performing for the birds.<br/>
Plastic, fog, and silver beam,<br/>
Here we are, falling into the in-between.<br/>
In the hope it will make the breakup less painful, we shared another Snickers.<br/>
It tasted good.<br/>
Goodbye Madeira.<br/>
A goodbye in Madeira.<br/>


### Lea Gander &  Matthias Sanoll with Alma Ragot and Sebastian Wieser 
Il corridore dell´ombra <br/>

The short film focuses on the shadow as a different kind of silhouette. One that emerges from within and shapes our perception of ourselves and others.
Suppressed desires and unacknowledged needs find expression through projection.
The dream state becomes a stage for these hidden dimensions, where they reveal themselves through fleeting images, distorted figures, and archetypal symbols.
The work portrays a community of such unconscious beings.
 It shows characters that do not exist in waking life, yet take shape in the way we perceive our surroundings, reflecting aspects of ourselves we may not always recognize as our own.<br/>
