### Liminal Nexus [Matthias Sanoll & Lea Gander]

Photoseries & Videoinstallation,
Portugal, 2025
It is as real as we make it.
Here we stand in the Liminal Nexus, on the threshold between ending and beginning.
Drifting away from the home we gave each other.
We blur, rearrange, dissolve, and return as something half-known.
Yes to be held by uncertainty.
Yes to reveal intimacy through distance.
Yes to linger in ambiguity.
Itâ€™s the pause before understanding, the momentum of dissolution and reformation.
BOOOOOOOOOOMMM
We untangle ourselves from the figure we merged into and run towards invisible horizons.
Come, come to a place far away from me.
What was my name again?
The sound of something breaking is the only thing we hear now.
Contradiction is the only tongue left while hiking 30 km a day and performing for the birds.
Plastic, fog, and silver beam,
Here we are, falling into the in-between.
In the hope it will make the breakup less painful, we shared another Snickers.
It tasted good.
Goodbye Madeira.
A goodbye in Madeira.
