### Element Lee

This work constructs images through character-based compositions that place ASCII characters alongside glyphs from ancient manuscripts. By examining characters and interfaces across both historical and contemporary contexts, it searches for inner calm and aesthetic autonomy amid political noise and algorithmic vertigo.
