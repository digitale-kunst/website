###  Rita Kulyk 

Souvenirs<br/>

The Souvenirs series is based on 3D scans of actual destroyed russian military vehicles exhibited during the Independence Day celebrations in Kyiv in 2022 and 2023.
These objects were later recreated in the delicate material of porcelain.
The aestheticization of war and its cult has always been present in russian society. Today, there is a significant production of military-themed objects made from porcelain, ranging from tank-shaped teapots to decorative military vehicles for household hold adornment.
