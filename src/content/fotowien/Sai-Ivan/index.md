### Sai Ivan

Niceland<br/>

The series Niceland captures Kyiv in a moment of suspended animation—a city paused during pandemic lockdown, emptied of people but still intact. These digitally rendered scenes depict flooded construction sites, exposed heating systems, vacant housing, and public spaces left unused. Everything carries a synthetic clarity: surfaces too smooth, too flawless, almost plastic. This hyperreal polish gives the environments an uncanny stillness, as if the world has  been wrapped in a digital film and set aside.<br/>
 
 There is no chaos here—only latency. Places meant for habitation or progress are frozen mid-function, pristine but purposeless. The gloss of the imagery suggests these are memory-models rather than lived spaces—echoes of a city reconstructed in digital solitude.<br/>
 
 In Niceland, absence becomes the main material. Human systems persist—heating, housing, construction—but no one is left to inhabit them. The result is a meditation on stasis, fragility, and the surreal perfection of abandoned infrastructure. The world hasn’t ended—it’s just been quietly evacuated, and left running without us.
