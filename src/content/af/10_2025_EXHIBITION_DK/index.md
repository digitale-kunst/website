# EXHIBITION at Digitale Kunst
# It’s Just a Fantasy: A Matter of Survival and Being Truthful

![](./AF25-itsjustafantasy-poster.jpg)

It's Just a Fantasy: A Matter of Survival and Being Truthful traces the line between survival and truth in a
world in crisis mode. Amidst AI agents, robots, and human deception, we search for figures of thought that do
not capitulate. Instead of apocalypse and dystopia: glitches, contradictions, desires. The exhibition asks
what remains when fantasy is not an escape, but a place where future is negotiated.
