# EXHIBITION at Digitale Kunst
# Itâ€™s Just a Fantasy: A Matter of Survival and Being Truthful


## Locations

Digitale Kunst spaces, Postsparkasse, GCP - Georg-Coch-Platz 2, 1010 Vienna
Floor 1, Department of Digitale Kunst <br/>

It's Just a Fantasy: A Matter of Survival and Being Truthful traces the line between survival and truth in a world in crisis mode. Amidst AI agents, robots, and human deception, we search for figures of thought that do not capitulate. Instead of apocalypse and dystopia: glitches, contradictions, desires. The exhibition asks what remains when fantasy is not an escape, but a place where future is negotiated.
