### NOISE AQUARIUM

## Location: Floor 1 at Postsparkasse/GCP - Department of Digitale Kunst

The internationally successful interactive AR and VR media art installation deals with noise and plastic pollution in the ocean. Plankton organisms were tomographically scanned and computer animated in the Science Visualization Lab. Immerse yourself in the world of plankton - if the balance of the ecosystem is achieved, whale songs will be heard, if not, noise pollution. Ongoing collaboration with the Art|Sci Center UCLA.
