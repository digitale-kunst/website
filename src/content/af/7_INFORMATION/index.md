### INFORMATION

## Location: Kassenhalle (Hochparterre) at Postsparkasse/GCP

### Installation/Performance, 29 June 2024, 17.00

INFORMATION is an installation that invites visitors to get involved in confusing narratives. Artworks created by students and presented at the INFO booth subvert the seemingly neutral conventions of informing by masquerading art as information. Developed in the lecture Vernetzter Sound with Thomas Felder.
