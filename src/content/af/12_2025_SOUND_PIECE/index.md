# SOUND PIECE
## I am walking in a house
## Einführung in Remote Recording

In the work I am sitting in a room (1969) by Alvin Lucier (1931–2021), speech is played and re-recorded in a room until it dissolves into the spatial resonances. This concept is expanded here by giving users the opportunity to let their own recording disappear into the resonances of a sequence of rooms in the Postsparkasse. As one moves through the building, they encounter traces of their own sound. Conceived as part of the seminar Introduction to

Remote Recording with Nicolaj Kirisits.
