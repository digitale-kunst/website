# The Big-Bug immersion 

The project proposes a 3D scanner to capture and create detailed models of insects. The scanner will serve as both an artistic and scientific instrument, raising social awareness for insect conservation. Additionally, the scanner will be featured as a “performance artist” depicting the scanning process and serving as an observational tool. Our research aims to contribute to the fields of art and science by exploring new forms of artistic expression through cutting-edge technology. Our ultimate goal is to promote research in digitization and AI by creating 3D models of organisms that will help raise awareness of their importance and contribute to their preservation.
