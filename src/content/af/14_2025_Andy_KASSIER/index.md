In a world where the self is staged, filtered, and commercialized, identity appears less as an unchanging truth and more as a kind of performanceâ€”a space open to experimentation. In his lecture, artist Andy Kassier explores how digital culture turns the self into a malleable material and how irony, role-play, and deliberate self-staging can be used to both question and reclaim the spectacle of identity.
