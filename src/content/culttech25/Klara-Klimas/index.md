A Bird That Mistook a Street Lamp for the Sun, 2025 <br/>


How do we swim in a world drowning in images?<br/>
Using void narration and methods of hyperlink cinema, I pose the question: what kind of sense-making is possible in times when we feel it slipping away?<br/>
In the form of a simple decision-making visual novel, you join a bird that mistakes the glow of a streetlamp for the Sun. Under overexposure, your navigation breaks, glitching together through a speculative landscape and the anatomy of pain itself. The body is a praying machine.<br/>
Together with the bird, you meet entities, ghosts of unlived futures, whispers of geological trauma, and the fragility inside planetary bones.
Deep time, catastrophism, and bodies of dust.<br/>
Dust to dust, welcome to the world without us.<br/>
Are you obsessed with beginnings?<br/>
Yes × yes.
