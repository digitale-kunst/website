Geisterjagd <br/>


"Geisterjagd" is a painting series that explores the intersection between technology, mysticism, and the forest as a haunted archive. Using obsolete devices like screens, tablets, and cameras as canvases, creates ghostly images inspired by post-digital aesthetics and horror. Each piece is linked to a short story—written as a creepypasta—published on a blog accessible via QR code, extending the artwork into a fictional archaeology of lost techno-civilizations.<br/>
