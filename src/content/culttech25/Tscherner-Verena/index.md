nie game over<br/>
Deflateable, Readymades, Electronics
2025<br/>

Arbitrariness in the randomness of failure. Torn back and forth by life. And yet, humans have
always gotten back up again. I suppose that means it’s never game over. Just like Maurice from
Bilderbuch tells us in the song of the same name: “Checkpoint – Nie game over.”
The chaos of breaking down, getting back up, collapsing under pressure, resisting pressure —
even defying it — rising again, starting over from scratch, is programmed into an increasingly
intense rhythm. It aims to make visible — and address — the sense of arbitrariness and the
feeling of sometimes being at the mercy of it all. Frustration tolerance and resilience are required
— and demanded anew every single day.
